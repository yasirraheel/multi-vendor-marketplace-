    "description": "'Educated: A Memoir' by Tara Westover is an astonishing true story of a woman's struggle for self-invention. Born to survivalists in the mountains of Idaho, Westover was seventeen when she first set foot in a classroom. Her quest for knowledge took her from a rural home where education was forbidden to the halls of Cambridge University. Despite lacking any formal education until she was a teenager, Westover's determination and willpower enabled her to earn a PhD. This memoir is a testament to the transformative power of education and the resilience of the human spirit."
